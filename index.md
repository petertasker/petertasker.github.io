## About Me

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Strathclyde. I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, have four cats, and enjoy playing the piano and guitar, although I'm terrible at both of them ðŸ˜‰.  

I'm currently on the look for seasonal internships while I am in my undergraduate course ðŸ‘€.

## What have I recently been up to?

(20/04/2025) I have been recently experimenting with web services, manipulating APIs for my benefit. I've made a scraper for the popular game distributor [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), and in invoice generator, which utilise `GET` and `POST` requests. You can find them at [Practical Python](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python).
