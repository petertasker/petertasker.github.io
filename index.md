## What have I recently been up to?

(20/04/2025) I have been recently experimenting with web services, manipulating APIs for my benefit. I've made a scraper for the popular game distributor [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), and in invoice generator, which utilise `GET` and `POST` requests. You can find them at [Practical Python](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python).
