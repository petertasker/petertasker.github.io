# Peter Tasker
## About Me
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Strathclyde. I'm from Glasgow, Scotland, I have four cats, and I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, although I'm terrible at both of them ðŸ˜‰.  
I'm currently on the look for seasonal internships while I am in my undergraduate course.

## Projects
Some cool projects that I've worked on recently
- [Scotbank](https://github.com/petertasker/scotbank) - A full-stack banking application written with a Springboot-esque Java framework, for a university module ran by JPMorganChase
- [100 Exercises to Learn Rust](https://github.com/petertasker/100-exercises-to-learn-rust) - A starter guide to learning the Rust language, covering traits, structs, concurrency, and much more
- [Practical Python](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python) - A series of python projects with real world applications
- [CS210 Shell](https://github.com/petertasker/cs210-shell) - A UNIX shell written in C

## What have I recently been up to?
(30/04/2025) I've written a couple more [practical python](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python) scripts, notably, an SMS service which will tell you the next upcoming LoL game, an automation tool that uses a local ML model to turn news articles into short summaries, which are then overlaid as captions on a neatly cropped version of the article's header image, as well as an interactive map which visualises the pinged server locations of your browser history. I'm considering looking into game development as an oppurtinity to learn Unity / C# or C++.

(20/04/2025) I have been recently experimenting with web services, manipulating APIs for my own personal benefit. I've made a scraper for the popular game distributor [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), and an invoice generator, which utilise `GET` and `POST` requests. You can find them at [Practical Python](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python).
