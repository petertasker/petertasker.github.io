# Peter Tasker
## About Me
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Strathclyde. I'm from Glasgow, Scotland, I have four 
cats, and I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, although I'm terrible at both of them ðŸ˜‰.  
I'm currently on the look for seasonal internships while I am in my undergraduate course.

## Projects
Some cool projects that I've worked on recently
- [**Shostakovich**](https://github.com/petertasker/shostakovich) - A historical stealth action game written in Godot
- [**Scotbank**](https://github.com/petertasker/scotbank) - A full-stack banking application written with a Springboot-esque
Java framework, for a university module ran by JPMorganChase (98% final grade)
- [**100 Exercises to Learn Rust**](https://github.com/petertasker/100-exercises-to-learn-rust) - A starter guide to 
learning the Rust language, covering traits, structs, concurrency, and much more
- [**Practical Python**](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python) - A series of python projects with real world 
applications
- [**Simple Shell**](https://github.com/petertasker/cs210-shell) - A UNIX shell written in C

## What have I recently been up to?

(06/05/2025) I've started creating some assets and small Godot scenes for a game I plan on creating called 
**"Shostakovich"**. It will be a 16-bit stealth game (somewhat akin to metal gear), where you play as Dmitri Shostakovich, a Soviet era composer, in the city of
Leningrad during it's 1941 invasion. You will have to evade both flavours of dictatorial regime whilst either crafting
Shostakovich's Symphony no.7, or transporting it -- I've not yet made up my mind. You can see how it's getting along 
[**here**](https://github.com/petertasker/shostakovich).

(30/04/2025) I've written a couple more [**Practical Python**](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python) scripts, 
notably, an SMS service which will tell you the next upcoming LoL game, an automation tool that uses a local ML model to
turn news articles into short summaries, which are then overlaid as captions on a neatly cropped version of the 
article's header image, as well as an interactive map which visualises the pinged server locations of your browser history. I'm considering looking into game development as an oppurtinity to learn Unity / C# or C++.

(20/04/2025) I have been recently experimenting with web services, manipulating APIs for my own personal benefit. 
I've made a scraper for the popular game distributor [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/), and an invoice generator,
which utilise `GET` and `POST` requests. You can find them at
[**Practical Python**](https://github.com/petertasker/practical-python).
